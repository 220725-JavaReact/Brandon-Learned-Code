## About Me

I originally came from a Mulesoft batch! I enjoy working on back end systems but also enjoy learning new technologies so I am very excited to be here and learn with everyone! On my free time, lately, I am learning how to create a purely Java-Based ripoff of Pokemon Red/Blue, and learning pixel art. I cannot wait to learn React!
